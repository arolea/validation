Drools components:
- Rules: The .drl files, stored in the production memory
- Facts: The data that is matched against the rules, stored in the working memory
- Agenda: Location where matching rules are sorted and executed (uses the Phreak algorithm)

Kie session types:
- Stateless: The inference process does not change the facts, data from a previous session is discarded before the next
invocation. Common for validation and calculation workloads.
- Stateful: The inference process can change facts, potentially triggering new rules, data is potentially reused
between sessions. Common for monitoring workloads. By default, facts are propagated lazily (an explicit call to
fireAllRules() is required after the insert() call).

Changes to global objects do not trigger rule reevaluation. Global objects are good candidates for getting results out
of rule eval.

Fact quality modes: identity (default, facts are considered identical if they point to the same object) and equality (
the equals() method is used to determine equality).

Salience defines rules execution order (useful for stateful sessions, when changes made to the facts by one rule can
trigger another rule)
